          <h2>But it's a gamble to try and find a recipe that doesn't end up with batter everywhere and sad, mushy cakes.</h2>
          <p>Well, I'm about to blow your mind here: there's different types of pancakes. You've got your fluffy, tall ones, and the ones that feel like a brick in your stomach.
          Maybe feeling like you just ate cement is your thing, I don't know. Moral of the story: one is significantly better than the other.</p>

          <section>
            <h2>So what are you gonna do about it?</h2>
            <h3>Let's start off with the ingredients</h3>
            <br>
            <p>So most pancake recipes tend to be pretty much the same, right? WRONG. A lot of em lack the things that make your pancakes light and fluffy, so you
            end up with mush and just an overall unpleasant breakfast experience.</p>
            <p>Out of all the pancake recipes that I've tried, this is hands down the best one. Trust me on this.</p>

            <ul>
              <h3>Heads up, this makes a LOT of pancakes</h3>
              <li>2 eggs, separate the whites from the yolks</li>
              <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
              <li>4 tbs melted butter</li>
              <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
              <li>2 tsp baking POWDER</li>
              <li>1 tsp baking SODA</li>
              <li>1 tsp salt</li>
              <li>2 tbs sugar</li>
              <li>OPTIONAL (but def recommend) - 1 ripe mashed banana + 1 cup white chocolate chips</li>

            </ul>
        </section>
        </div>

        <div class="parallax-container3">
          <section>
            <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Start by adding the egg whites into a bowl and whipping them until it's all white and foamy. In a separate bowl,
              combine the buttermilk, butter, egg yolks, and banana if you ended up adding it. Mix all that together.</li>
              <li>In a separate bowl, mix the dry ingredients together and then mix the dry ingredients into the wet. Add the white chocolate. Now gently fold
              in the whipped egg whites, this is what makes your pancakes super fluffy and slightly crispy on the outside. DO NOT OVERMIX.</li>
              <li>Batter all ready? Sick, time to heat up a greased nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
              <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter into the pan (you can do multiple cakes at once this way). Turn the heat down a little bit.
              Often people put batter down on a pan that's too hot and you end up with burnt pancakes that are raw in the middle. No fun.</li>
              <li>Let the pancakes cook until the edges look dry and you see small bubbles form, or until the bottom is golden and flip. Cook the other side till it's golden. BE PATIENT! this
              batter is THICK and takes a bit longer to cook, but it's so worth it.</li>
              <li>BAM. YA GOT SOME PERFECT PANCAKES.</li>
            </ol>
